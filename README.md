Your Project's Name
ROMEO_TEACUP
One or two paragraphs providing an overview of your project.
Essentially, this part is your sales pitch.
Romeo_Teacup is a website designed to advertise and showcase the dog Romeo in the best and most professional way by providing as much information on Romeo to incite visitors to make contact via the site for new bookings for film, photography and advertising work. For fans of Romeo they can find all his social media platforms information. There are links to Romeo’s external merchandise shop, in the hope that visitors to the site will click through, view the shop and buy merchandise using the discount code. This is a way of giving back and saying thank you for visiting the site. As well as acting as an incentive to check out his merchandise store and receive a discount.

UX
Use this section to provide insight into your UX process, focusing on who this website is for, what it is that they want to achieve and how your project is the best way to help them achieve these things.
In particular, as part of this section we recommend that you provide a list of User Stories, with the following general structure:
As a user type, I want to perform an action, so that I can achieve a goal.
As a casting agent for a new commercial, I want to find out what previous work the dog has done, the dogs measurements and see as many photos as possible.
As a dog lover I want to see more photos and videos of the dog by way of obtaining all social media information. 
As a dog owner, I want to find out where Romeo gets most of his clothes from and buy something similar for my dog but they didn’t know Romeo had his own dog boutique.
As the director of a new dog company, I want to find out whereabouts in the UK Romeo is based as I am looking for cute dog ambassadors that require little training to attend events.
As a music manager I saw Romeo and was given a business card that had www.romeoteacup.com website on it. I’m looking for cute dog for a video shoot and need to find out Romeo’s location and availability.
As magazine editor I want to do a piece on Romeo and would like to find out more information about him such as age and see more of his talent and skills.






Features
In this section, you should go over the different parts of your project, and describe each in a sentence or so.

Existing Features
Feature 1 - allows users X to achieve Y, by having them fill out Z
Feature 1 hero-outer
Feature 1 about-me
Feature 1 measurements
The measurement section was divided into 2 columns with a photo illustrating a dog being measured alongside a bullet point list of his measurements. This is vital information to people who may want to book Romeo for work, therefore I created this section to stand alone and positioned it near the about me section at the top of the page as I want the information to be clearly visible to the user.
Feature 1 discount-code
The discount code section & where it is just above the romescloset shop jumbatron -  allows all visitors of the site to obtain a discount code to be used on an external site called www.romescloset.com where all his merchandise is sold. This will work as an incentive for visitors of the site to visit his store and use the discount code. It also acts as a reward for visitors for checking out the site www.romeoteacup.com

Feature romes-closet
The romescloset shop jumbatron taken from bootstrap provides an external link to a dog boutique owned by Romeo that sells dog clothes and accessories. Visitors of the site will have an interest in dogs or own a dog themselves, therefore I wanted to utilise this information site I created to advertise his shop as a way of driving traffic further to www.romescloset.com.

Feature tik-tok

Feature 1 instagram

For some/all of your features, you may choose to reference the specific project files that implement them, although this is entirely optional.

Testing
In this section, you need to convince the assessor that you have conducted enough testing to legitimately believe that the site works well. Essentially, in this part you will want to go over all of your user stories from the UX section and ensure that they all work as intended, with the project providing an easy and straightforward way for the users to achieve their goals.
Whenever it is feasible, prefer to automate your tests, and if you've done so, provide a brief explanation of your approach, link to the test file(s) and explain how to run them.
For any scenarios that have not been automated, test the user stories manually and provide as much detail as is relevant. A particularly useful form for describing your testing process is via scenarios, such as:
Contact form:
Go to the "Contact Us" page
Try to submit the empty form and verify that an error message about the required fields appears
Try to submit the form with an invalid email address and verify that a relevant error message appears
Try to submit the form with all inputs valid and verify that a success message appears.
In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.
You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.
If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.

Deployment
This section should describe the process you went through to deploy the project to a hosting platform (e.g. GitHub Pages or Heroku).
In particular, you should provide all details of the differences between the deployed version and the development version, if any, including:
Different values for environment variables (Heroku Config Vars)?
Different configuration files?
Separate git branch?
In addition, if it is not obvious, you should also describe how to run your code locally.
